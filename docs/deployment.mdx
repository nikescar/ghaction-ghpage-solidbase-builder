# Deployment

Learn how to deploy your Jekyll Solidbase Theme site to various platforms.

## GitHub Pages

The easiest way to deploy is using GitHub Pages:

1. Push your site to a GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Set the source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    
    - name: Build site
      run: npx tsx build.ts
    
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      with:
        github_token: ${ { secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN } }
        publish_dir: ./
        exclude_assets: '.github,node_modules,src,*.ts,*.json,*.lock'
```

## Netlify

Deploy to Netlify with continuous integration:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npx tsx build.ts`
3. Set publish directory: `./`
4. Deploy!

## Vercel

Deploy to Vercel:

1. Import your GitHub repository
2. Set framework preset to "Other"
3. Set build command: `npx tsx build.ts`
4. Set output directory: `./`
5. Deploy!

## Manual Deployment

For manual deployment to any static hosting provider:

1. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx tsx build.ts
   ```

2. Upload the generated files (excluding source files) to your hosting provider

3. Ensure your server serves `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)

## Build Process

The build process does the following:

1. Reads configuration from `_config.yml`
2. Builds the SolidJS application with Vinxi
3. Copies build output to the root directory
4. Cleans up temporary build directories (`.output`, `.vinxi`)

This ensures your site is ready for Jekyll hosting while using modern web technologies.
