# Deployment

Learn how to deploy your Jekyll Solidbase Theme site using GitHub Workflow.

**Current Status:** This theme currently uses GitHub Workflow for deployment rather than traditional Jekyll processing. Jekyll integration is planned for future development.

## GitHub Pages (Recommended)

The theme is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions workflow:

### Prerequisites

1. A GitHub repository containing your documentation
2. GitHub Pages enabled in repository settings
3. Source set to "GitHub Actions"

### Setup

1. **Create the deployment workflow** at `.github/workflows/vite.docs.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy vite built sites to github pages
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${ { steps.deployment.outputs.page_url } }
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: clone solidbase theme github
        run: |
          git clone https://github.com/nikescar/mdx-sitegen-solidbase.git .solidbase --depth 1
          pushd ./.solidbase
          bash ghworkflow.sh
          popd

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './.solidbase/.output/public'
          
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

2. **Configure your site** with `_config.yml`:

```yaml
# Site settings
title: Your Site Title
description: Your site description

# Include in processing
include:
  - index.md
  - docs/
  - resources/

# Exclude from processing  
exclude:
  - _includes
  - _layouts
  - .github
  - node_modules

# Theme settings
site_author: Your Name
repo_url: 'https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo'
site_url: 'https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo'
site_favicon: './resources/favicon.ico'
```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
   - Source: GitHub Actions
   - Save

4. **Deploy**: Push changes to the main branch and the workflow will automatically build and deploy your site.

## How the Deployment Works

The GitHub workflow performs these steps:

1. **Checkout** your repository content
2. **Clone** the Jekyll Solidbase Theme to `.solidbase/` directory
3. **Execute** the build script (`ghworkflow.sh`) which:
   - Copies your content to the theme's source directory
   - Processes include/exclude rules from `_config.yml`
   - Installs npm dependencies
   - Builds the SolidJS application with Vinxi
   - Copies static assets and favicon
4. **Upload** the built site to GitHub Pages
5. **Deploy** to your GitHub Pages URL

## Build Process Details

The `ghworkflow.sh` script handles:

- **Content Integration**: Copies your markdown files and assets into the theme structure
- **Configuration Processing**: Reads your `_config.yml` for include/exclude rules
- **Asset Management**: Handles favicon, images, and other static resources
- **SolidJS Build**: Compiles the modern web application
- **Output Preparation**: Prepares the final static site for deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow fails**: Check that GitHub Pages is enabled and source is set to "GitHub Actions"
2. **404 errors**: Ensure your `site_url` in `_config.yml` matches your GitHub Pages URL
3. **Missing assets**: Check that files are included in the `include:` section of `_config.yml`
4. **Build errors**: Verify that your markdown files have valid frontmatter

### Checking Deployment Status

1. Go to your repository's "Actions" tab
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Review the logs for any errors
4. Check that the deployment step completed successfully

## Future: Traditional Jekyll Support

Traditional Jekyll theme usage with `remote_theme` is planned for future development. This will allow:

- Standard Jekyll site generation
- Local development with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Compatibility with existing Jekyll hosting providers

Currently, the theme focuses on providing a modern, fast documentation experience through the GitHub Workflow deployment method.
